DayMet NetCDF (.nc) raw files for North-America should be placed here. As the whole database is greater than 2to, it will not be copied here and uploaded on GitHub for obvious reasons.

The attached bash script `batch_download_daymet.sh` allows you to easily download the whole DayMet database (1980-2021) for all the relevent variables (tmax, tmin, prcp, srad, vp, swe, dayl).
